# A Guide to Clustering

This repository should serve as a guide book for building clustering models. The main steps are:

1) Preprocessing
    * Categorical Parameters
    * Data Normalization
2) Analysis
    * Hopkins Statistics
3) Different Clustering Methods
    * k-Means
    * Expectation Maximization
    * OPTICS
    * Spectral Clustering
    * Hierarchical Clustering

As an illustrative example we will use the "Customer Personality Analysis" dataset published [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). The analysis will be done using the Python library `scikit-learn` in a Jupyter notebook.
